# Ludum Dare 40 : _The more you have, the worse it is._

Thanks for playing my first Ludum Dare game! I look forward to hearing your feedback.

# About

- You are the yellow capsule! You can carry a ball.

- Opponents are the teal capsules! They can carry balls too.

- Common enemy is the purple capsules! Will chase down those who have a ball.

- As you hold the ball longer the purple capsule will chase you faster, so you must throw ball to your opponents.

- Everyone has 3 lives. 

- Last capsule standing wins!

# Controls

- Press 'Space' bar to start the game.

- Control your characters movement by holding down or clicking right mouse button .

- Throw the ball by clicking right mouse button on opponent.

- To start over, restart the game :(

- Full screen recommended.

# Issues / Suggestions

Sometimes the purple capsules go on high velocity off the map, but don't worry they always seem to return :P

**If you see any bugs or have any suggestions**, please create a Git issue in this repo. If possible, try and determine conditions for the scenario to occur.

# Code

Towards the end of Ludum Dare 40, when submission deadlines started to approach, I started to lose quality in my overall game design and binding flow. I started noticing myself put in more hacks that I'll "resolve later"--sounds like a typical hackathon to me. Because of this there are a few places in my code that I want to revisit to remove coupling and non-optimal design patterns.

# Configuration Changes

I will soon be releasing a patch for any bugs discovered while testing, as well as a configurable settings for the game so you can run with different amounts of players, balls, chasers, and their various speeds. There are various tunings you can do to units to creates interesting behaviors that will be fun to experiment with! I will publish that after I get some much needed sleep.

# Future

Following this update will come some of the more "nice-to-have" features that we thought of but never got time to implement. One of these includes a healthy dose of refactoring in order to prepare for network behavior scripts. The full list of these future features are listed on the project's Trello board.
