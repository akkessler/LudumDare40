# Ludum Dare 40 : _The more you have, the worse it is._

https://akessler.itch.io/ld40

Thanks for playing my first Ludum Dare game! I look forward to hearing your feedback.

*Full screen recommended*

# About

- You are the **`yellow capsule`**--you can carry a ball

- Opponents are the **`teal capsules`**--they can carry balls too

- Hunters are the **`purple capsules`**--they chase down and kill those who have a ball

- As you hold a ball longer the purple capsule will **`chase you faster`**

- **`Throw the ball`** to your opponents to try get them killed

- Everyone has 3 lives by default

- Last capsule standing wins!

# Controls

## Play

- **`Space`** bar to reset the game and cancel the active round (if any)

- **`Space`** again to begin the round

- **`Right Mouse Button`** hold or click to move player

- **`Left Mouse Button`** click on opponent to throw the ball

## Config Menus

- **`1`** Game Properties 

- **`2`** Hunter Properties

- **`3`** Opponent Properties

- **`4`** Player Properties

- **`5`** Ball Properties

# Configuration Changes

_**If you find any values that work particularly well please share them!**_

Control different properties of the game through the interactive UI sliders. 
This includes values like `maxSpeed`, `acceleration`, `lives`, etc. Currently some values require a restart of the game (through `Space` commmand), while others will reflect immediately.

# Bugs / Issues / Suggestions

Sometimes the purple capsules go on high velocity off the map, but don't worry they always seem to return :P

**If you see any bugs or have any suggestions**, please open a GitHub issue. If possible, try and determine conditions for the scenario to occur.

# Future

When I get more time, I will implement some of the "nice-to-have" features that were thought of but never got time to implement. One of these includes a healthy dose of refactoring in order to prepare for network behavior scripts. The full list of these future features are listed on the project's Trello board.
